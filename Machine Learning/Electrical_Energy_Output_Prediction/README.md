In this project, dataset of a combined cycle power plant is used to predict its output energy. The four independent variables were Temperature, Exhaust Vacuum, Ambient Pressure and Relative Humidity. 5 machine learning models based on 5 different algorithms were made to predict the output energy and the following was their accuracy result:
Decision Tree model : 92.3%
Multiple Linear Regression: 93.3%
Polynomial Regression: 94.6%
Random Forest Regression: 96.2%
Support Vector Machine (SVR) : 94.8% 

From the above observation, it is evident that Random forest has the best accuracy for this particular dataset.
